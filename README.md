[MCS Exchange](https://mycoinstory.com/) This is a sample code for each language to use the OPEN API. The languages ​​that provide samples are as follows.

- [Python](sample-python.py)
- Java (WIP)
- NodeJS (WIP)

For each language sample, the library dependency is minimized so that you can understand how to use it as easily as possible, and code duplication was allowed and no refactoring. We recommend using it for the purpose of understanding how to use.

If there is no language required to use the OPEN API in the list above, please request it at [Issue Page](https://github.com/mcs-exchange/api-samples/issues) and we will add it.

## Requirements
To use the sample, API_KEY and API_SECRET are required at MCS exchange. After logging in to MCS, you need to issue an API key at [API issuance page](https://mycoinstory.com/account/api).
Samples for each language have been checked for operation in the version below.

|Language | Version       |
|---------|:-------------:|
|Python   | >= `3.6.x`    |
|Java     | >= `1.8.x`    |
|NodeJS   | >= `v14.15.1` |

## Execution
In the code, change the part of `<INPUT_YOUR_API_KEY>` `<INPUT_YOUR_API_SECRET>` to your key issued above and enter the execution command for each language.

### Python
```python 
python sample-python.py
```
### Java
```java
```
### NodeJS
```nodejs
```

## Feedback
If you have a problem with the code or documentation, please leave an issue on the [Issue Page](https://github.com/mcs-exchange/api-samples/issues). We will give you feedback as soon as possible.
