This is a sample code for languages used for the [MCS](https://mycoinstory.com) Open API. Samples are provided for the following languages.

- [Python](sample-python.py)
- Java (WIP)
- NodeJS (WIP)

For each language sample, we have minimized the library dependency so that it can be used as simple as possible. The sample also allowed code duplication and did not conduct any refactoring. We recommend using it for the purpose of understanding how to use the Open API.

If there is no language in the list above for using the Open API, please request it on the [issue page](https://github.com/mcs-exchange/api-samples/issues) and we will add it.

## Requirements
To use the sample, API_KEY and API_SECRET are required on MCS. After logging in to MCS, you need to issue an API key at the [API issuance page](https://mycoinstory.com/account/api).

Samples for each language have been checked for execution in the versions below.

|Language | Version       |
|---------|:-------------:|
|Python   | >= `3.6.x`    |
|Java     | >= `1.8.x`    |
|NodeJS   | >= `v14.15.1` |

## Execution
In the code, change the  `<INPUT_YOUR_API_KEY>`, `<INPUT_YOUR_API_SECRET>` to your key issued and enter the execution command for each language.

### Python
```python 
python sample-python.py
```
### Java
```java
```
### NodeJS
```nodejs
```

## Feedback
If you have a problem with the code or documentation, please leave an issue on the [Issue Page](https://github.com/mcs-exchange/api-samples/issues). We will reply as soon as possible.
